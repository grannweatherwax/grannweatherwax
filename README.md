👋 Hi, I’m CJ aka @grannweatherwax. I have a background in archaeology and have been teaching myself development since 2020. 
# 👀 Interests
I'm always interested in understanding how stuff works - how it is put together, what makes it tick. This is just as true for plants growing in a garden as it is for a game I like playing. 
Current interests at the top of the list:
- game development
- fiction writing
- baseball

# 🌱 Learning 
I'm working on learning a few different languages through making projects, though these are not necessarily public repos here. 
These include:
- a macOS app using SwiftUI for advanced pdf manipulation
- a cross platform mobile app using JavaScript, Node.js, and Cordova for personal nutrition tracking and management
- a PC game using GDScript in Godot

# 💞️ Collaboration
I'm at a stage where I want to build up a portfolio of work that I'm proud of using the languages that I've been learning. I'd enjoy collaborative development in any of the languages I've mentioned above. 
In particular, if you have a small game idea or an app idea that you want to pursue and need a second keyboard on, I'm interested.
